{"openapi":"3.0.0","info":{"title":"Public EMMA API","description":"### About Infrastructure API\n\n**Base URL:** **<u>https://api.emma.ms/external</u>**\n\n This **Infrastructure API** is for managing the emma cloud infrastructure within a project. The API enables you to view, create, edit, and delete _Virtual machines, Spot instances, Applications, Kubernetes clusters, SSH keys, Security groups, and Backup policies_. For creating the resources you can use the endpoints with the dictionaries: _Data centers, Locations, Providers, Operating systems, Virtual machines configurations, Spot instances configurations, Kubernetes clusters configurations._\n\n ### Authentication\n\n #### 1. Create service application\n\n To access the API, enter your project, navigate to **Settings** > **Service Apps**, and create a service application. Select the access level **Read**, **Operate**, or **Manage**.\n\n - **Read** - only GET methods are allowed in the API.\n\n - **Operate** - some operations are allowed with the resources (e.g. _Start, Reboot,_ and _Shutdown_ of the Virtual machines).\n\n - **Manage** - full creating, updating, and deleting of the resources is allowed.\n\n\n #### 2. Get access token\n\n - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in the service application.\n - Send an API request to the endpoint **/issue-token** as specified in the **Authentication** section of the API documentation. You will receive access and refresh tokens in the response.\n\n _For Linux / Mac:_\n ```\n curl -X POST https://api.emma.ms/external/v1/issue-token \\\n -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n -d '{\"clientId\": \"YOUR-CLIENT-ID\", \"clientSecret\": \"YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET\"}'\n ```\n _For Windows:_\n ```\n curl -X POST https://api.emma.ms/external/v1/issue-token ^\n -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" ^\n -d \"{\\\"clientId\\\": \\\"YOUR-CLIENT-ID\\\", \\\"clientSecret\\\": \\\"YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET\\\"}\"\n ```\n\n #### 3. Use access token in requests\n The Bearer access token is a text string, included in the request header, for example:\n\n _For Linux / Mac:_\n ```\n curl -X GET https://api.emma.ms/external/v1/locations -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN-HERE\"\n ```\n\n Use this token for the API requests. \n\n #### 4. Refresh token\n The access token will expire in 10 minutes. A new access token may be created using the refresh token (without Client ID and Client Secret).\n\n To get a new access token send a request to the **/refresh-token** endpoint:\n\n\n _For Linux / Mac:_\n ```\n curl -X POST https://api.emma.ms/external/v1/refresh-token \\\n -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n -d '{\"refreshToken\": \"YOUR-REFRESH-TOKEN\"}'\n ```    \n\n ### Possible response status codes\n\n We use standard HTTP response codes to show the success or failure of requests.\n\n `2xx` - successful responses.\n\n `4xx` - client error responses (the response contains an explanation of the error).\n\n `5xx` - server error responses.\n\n The API uses the following status codes:\n\n | Status Code | Description                  | Notes                                                                  |\n |-------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n | 200         | OK                           | The request was successful.                                             |\n | 201         | Created                      | The object was successfully created. This code is only used with objects that are created immediately.\n | 204         | No content                   | A successful request, but there is no additional information to send back in the response body (in a case when the object was deleted).  \n | 400         | Bad Request                  | The request could not be understood by the server. Incoming parameters might not be valid. |\n | 401         | Unauthorized            | The client is unauthenticated. The client must authenticate itself to get the requested response. |\n | 403         | Forbidden                   | The client does not have access rights to the content.\n | 404         | Not Found                    | The requested resource is not found.                                    |\n | 409         | Conflict | This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the object (e.g. deleting the security group with the compute instances in it).|\n | 422         | Unprocessable Content   | The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to incorrect field values (e.g. creation of a virtual machine in the non-existent data center).  |\n | 500         | Internal server Error                 | The server could not return the representation due to an internal server error. |\n","version":"1.0.1"},"servers":[{"url":"https://api.emma.ms/external","description":"Public EMMA API"}],"tags":[{"name":"Authentication","description":"Includes two endpoints for obtaining access tokens for authentication in the current API. The first endpoint enables you to get an access token and a refresh token. To send a request, you first need to create a Service application in your project (in the Settings section). After creating the application, you will get a Client ID and a Client Secret. Use them in your API request body to get the access and refresh tokens.\n\nThe second endpoint is used for getting a new access token using the refresh token. Since the access token can expire in a few minutes, you can generate a new access token without providing the Client ID and Client Secret.\n"},{"name":"Compute instances configurations","description":"When creating virtual machines, spot instances, or Kubernetes clusters, you need to provide the desired hardware configurations. These configurations include CPU, CPU type, RAM, volume size, and volume type. Different cloud providers offer various configurations in different data centers. Therefore, before creating any compute instance, you need to verify the available configurations.\n\nUse these three endpoints as references for available configurations for virtual machines, spot instances, and Kubernetes clusters. You can search the available configurations by different parameters (provider, location, data center, cloud network type, CPU, CPU type, RAM, volume size, volume type, and price).\n\nWhen you find an appropriate configuration, provide the hardware parameters in the endpoint for creating or editing a virtual machine, spot instance, or Kubernetes cluster.\n"},{"name":"Data centers","description":"Data centers from cloud providers.

When you create any computing resources in emma you create them in the provider's datacenters.\n"},{"name":"Security groups","description":"A security group refers to a set of rules that determine what network traffic is allowed to enter or leave a particular network or system. It acts as a virtual firewall, controlling inbound and outbound traffic based on predefined rules.\nSecurity groups operate based on predefined rules that allow or deny traffic based on specified criteria, such as source IP address, destination IP address, port number, and protocol. You can create and modify security groups, and add or delete compute instances from the security group.\n"},{"name":"Spot instances","description":"A Spot Instance is a specialized compute instance that allows you to access and utilize unused instance capacity at a steeply discounted rate.  Spot price is charged on an hourly basis.\n"},{"name":"SSH keys","description":"Provides endpoints for managing SSH keys within the project.

You can't retrieve a list of SSH keys created by other users. You can't use other user's SSH keys when creating compute instances.\n"},{"name":"Statistics","description":"The method allows extraction of statistical data from emma's DWH.
